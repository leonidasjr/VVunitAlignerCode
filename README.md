# VVunitAlignerCode_webMAUS

Script implemented by Leônidas Silva Jr., CH/UEPB, Brazil, based originally on Florian Schiel's webMAUS aligner (KISLER et al., 2017). It post-processes canonical/phonological syllable-sized units returned by the original MAUS alignment, into vowel onset-to-vowel onset (phonetic syllable ) units for latter automatic extraction of metric and acoustic-prosodic parameters (see Silva Jr. & Barbosa’s, 2019, 2021, and Barbosa’s, 2020 scripts for the reference task). 
So far, VVUnitAligner script can be used on four different languages: Brazilian Portuguese (BR), English (US), Spanish (ES) and French (FR) (adjusts are under development).
As far as new versions are available, they will be updated in our GitHub repository: <https://github.com/leonidasjr/VVunitAlignerCode_webMAUS>.
